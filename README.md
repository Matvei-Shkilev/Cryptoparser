# Cryptoparser


I created a cryptopasrer to quickly find a cryptocoin. 

After running the script, you will have a csv file, open it and analyze the table.

1st column - coin name
2nd column - short name of the coin
3rd column - coin price in $
4th column - link to this coin
5th column - link to chart
